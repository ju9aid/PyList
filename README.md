# PyList

`PyList` is a C++ implementation of a dynamic list similar to Python's list. It supports various operations such as appending, inserting, popping, counting, extending, removing, reversing, and sorting elements of any type.

## Features

- **Append**: Add an element to the end of the list.
- **Insert**: Insert an element at a specific index.
- **Pop**: Remove and return an element at a specific index (default is the last element).
- **Count**: Count the occurrences of a specific value in the list.
- **Extend**: Add elements from another list to the end of the current list.
- **Remove**: Remove the first occurrence of a specific value.
- **Reverse**: Reverse the order of elements in the list.
- **Sort**: Sort the elements in the list.
- **Clear**: Remove all elements from the list.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ju9aid/PyList.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:

`cd PyList`

PyList is designed to make list operations in C++ as intuitive and flexible as they are in Python, bringing together the best of both worlds. Enjoy coding!
